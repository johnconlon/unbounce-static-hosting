# Unbounce
This module contains helper functions and components for injecting applications into Unbounce pages. It provides functions for rendering an application into the page, functions for managing Unbounce forms, and a component to easily integrate with Preact applications.


## Requirements
A few assumptions are made to facilitate the Unbounce integration. In addition to being documented here, they are noted in documentation for the relevant functions and components.

- A "Custom HTML" element must be included in the Unbounce page in the Unbounce visual builder containing a div with a custom ID. That ID is passed to the `init` function found in `./pages.ts`.
- For form filling to work, the Unbounce page must contain a form and the names of the fields in that form must match exactly with whatever form (or form data) is produced by the application. Otherwise the matching of form data to Unbounce form will fail.
