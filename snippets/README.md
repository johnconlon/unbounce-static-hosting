## Snippets

These are non-production files (i.e. not loaded into Unbounce pages) that we keep here for reference
and posterity.

For example, the [./tracking.js](tracking.js) file was removed from the Unbounce scripts manager and will be migrated to our upcoming build system to be compiled from multiple sources.
